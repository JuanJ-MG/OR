This repository contains my work from the Fall 2024 System Optimization / Operations Research course, where I formulated and solved real engineering decision-making problems using mathematical optimization.

The repository includes:
	•	Homework, quizzes, and selected exam problems
	•	Full optimization formulations and solution code
	•	End-to-end models: from problem definition → constraints → objective → solution

What I worked on:
	•	Building Linear Programming (LP) and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) models
	•	Translating real-world systems into mathematical formulations
	•	Making trade-offs between cost, time, and resource constraints
	•	Analyzing and interpreting optimization results

Key skills demonstrated:
	•	Operations Research & optimization modeling
	•	Structured problem formulation
	•	Engineering decision-making under constraints
	•	Clean, reproducible optimization code


This repository reflects how I approach complex systems: structured, quantitative, and solution-oriented.
